Novel Optical Flow estimation Algorithm 

A novel simple optical flow algorithm for motion estimation is presented. For more details about it look at the paper published on
https://www.ripublication.com/ijaer18/ijaerv13n17_43.pdf. 

We present  a  novel  three  frame  motion  estimation algorithm that uses information obtained from a single imaging subtraction
to  estimate  the  motion  of  a  single  object  on  a motionless image scene. The first step is to obtain two sets of 
new  and  old  pixels  in  motion  by  subtracting  three  frames. Then, from defining the centroids of the given sets is derived 
an estimated  displacement  of  the  studied  object.  Evaluation was  made  in  comparison  with  three  optical  flow  estimation 
algorithms. Results shows low computational cost and higher precision.
